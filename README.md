# fukasawa_rbge
A Wordpress Child theme of Fukasawa


## Project Theme banners

Themed projects are bound to specific categories and rules added to the style.css

Each uses a banner (not compulsory) that should be 90px high and 1,180 wide. The left hand part of the banner is hidden as the page shrinks so the main logo should stay on the right. The minimum size when the page is at its smallest is 288px. Single post pages are 973 pixels wide so it makes sense for there to be a natural break at that point i.e. nothing cut in half.

Numbering pixels from the right looks like this:

max: 1,180px ---------------- single post: 973px -------------------------------------- min 288px ----------- 0px

Numbering pixels from left:

0px ----------------- single post: 207px -------------------------------------- min 892px ------------------- max: 1,180px

Optionally the banner could be smaller but with a transparent background.
